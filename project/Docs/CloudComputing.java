Cloud computing, also known as on-demand computing, is a kind of Internet-based computing, where shared resources,data and information are provided to computers and other devices on-demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers.It relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over a network.At the foundation of cloud computing is the broader concept of converged infrastructure and shared services.
